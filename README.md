#CAPS CMS
##Yet another Content Management System. 

This is my professional Pet Project and a tool that some People might use to manage the content of their Websites. I certainly will.

Caps was a Windows Forms Application since 2002. This is fresh Start using Durandal, Bootstrap, Q, Breeze and other cool things on the Front and ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, Code First, Ninject and more on the Backend.

By publishing the Source I hope to be helpful for some and get useful feedback and advise from others. I know there are enough CMS-Systems out there. This shall be more of a training in building a solid and professional Software Solution. 
The outcome shall be a CMS-System that I and some of my customers use to manage their Websites or Blogs or parts of it. Just because it is more fun to produce something useful while learning.

So if you see me doing something terribly wrong. Please give me a hint.
